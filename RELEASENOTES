[*]Targets will now appear correctly on your screen, but you MUST bind a key to "Target Last Target" [/list]

[list]PVP 
[*]PvP entirely re-written from scratch. Simply create a PvP behavior, select it on the Bot screen and click start bot! It takes care of itself. 
[*]The new PVP tab is now working. You can queue up for multiple battlegrounds or use the "Random Battleground" feature if you are level 80. Please make sure you select a route for each battleground you wish to enable. 
[*]PG will now detect when a battleground ends and port you out for requeue. Option to delay leaving the BG in PvP behaviors. [/list]

[list]Routes 
[*]If PG is unable to find your body after running the route once, it will stop 
[*]Improved route switching from corpse route to primary

[*]"Stay Mounted" removed. Add a mount rule to Patrolling and it will operate the same way. 
[*]Fixed "Switch to start route on death" option, it should now work correctly [/list]

[list]Other 
[*]The auto updating system is now in place. Starting with the next version after this one, you will get a prompt when a new version is available and will have the option to install it right away, without having to go anywhere. Pocket Gnome will update itself and relaunch.[/list]

[list]Notes 
[*]Auto updating will not work if you have renamed your application. The program will tell you that there's an update available but it will error out when you try to install it. You will have to download the update manually and apply it yourself. 
[*]You can now follow Pocket Gnome on twitter to get important updates and releases notifications. Just follow @pocketgnomewow and you will be all set.
