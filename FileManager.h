// this is my version "2" of the file manager, realizing the original SaveData didn't have enough flexibility for my liking!
//	What assumptions do we need? Objects that are passed MUST have the following:
//		- a property called name
//		- a string called objectExtension

#import <Cocoa/Cocoa.h>

@class SaveDataObject;

@interface FileManager : NSObject {

}

// we shouldn't really use this
+ (FileManager*)sharedFileManager;

// save all objects in the array
- (BOOL)saveObjects:(NSArray*)objects;

// save one object
- (BOOL)saveObject:(SaveDataObject*)obj;

// get all objects with the extension
- (NSArray*)getObjectsWithClass:(Class)class;

// delete the object with this file name
- (BOOL)deleteObjectWithFilename:(NSString*)filename;

// delete an object
- (BOOL)deleteObject:(SaveDataObject*)obj;

// gets the filename (not path) for an object
- (NSString*)filenameForObject:(SaveDataObject*)obj;

// old method
- (NSArray*)dataForKey: (NSString*)key withClass:(Class)class;
