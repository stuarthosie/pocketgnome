#summary List of 1.5 changes we're going to make

= To Do =

 * ~~stop looting on full inventory~~
 *  ~~flying off into death when gathering ~~
 * stutter step before casting - wtf is this?
 * ~~disappearing phased gathering nodes~~ this is a Blizz problem, not ours
 * run past corpse and not rez
 * corpse run needs to connect to first wp of route
 * combat behaviors tend to require /cleartarget /targetlasttarget
 * % based mana / power etc checks are buggy?
 * mail actions don't (always?) manage to interact with the mailbox
 * mail actions don't (always?) mail all items they should
 * pg cannot be stopped while executing mail actions (usleep blocks the ui thread)
 * waypoint actions are sometimes (always?) executed on the previous waypoint
 * relative coordinate spaces such as the travelers' tundra mammoth vendors and people on boats / zeps
 * dk characters don't attack targets that are engaged with their temporary pet
 * the bot doesn't engage npcs that are engaged with another npc, such as the ones on the th shore (related to the previous one?)
 * ~~the ability to enter a macros text into the route /~~ profile
 * ~~automatic tracking of skill levels would be awesome~~
 * ~~when you create or import a new profile it doesn't appear in the list on the bot tab without restarting pg~~
 * ~~automatic bg queueing~~
 * ~~new pvp zones~~
 * when anti-stuck doesn't work try strafing and/or moving back a little and then strafing
 * ~~the /startattack checkbox under behaviors is not saved~~
 * godmode
 * ~~ignore nearby elites when gathering~~
 * ignore everything while mounted
 * the size of fishing pools pg uses to detect if the bobber landed in a pool could possibly be increased
 * ~~new, smarter ghost routes, automatically chooses the fastest path on your route instead of running all the way through the route~~
 * ~~save button for routes, so pg doesn't have to be closed to save~~
 * ~~gather ANYTHING~~
 * ~~better blacklisting of nodes, character position blacklisting~~
